Saliens script running on headless chrome

This is a work in progress node.js program.
In the future I am hoping for this to be a reliable way to run a Saliens script on a server.

Current version can be buggy and only works for Steam Guard Authenticator users.

The current version is based on a Saliens userscript made by [coryshaw1](https://github.com/coryshaw1/saliens-hack)

I am not responsible if Gaben kicks your ass.
